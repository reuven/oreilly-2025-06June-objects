    "Software is hard to write, and it's even harder to maintain.\n",

    "Back in the 1970s, people thought about this a *lot*. One of them is named Alan Kay. Kay thought about what was hard about programming, and how to make it easier. The problem was (and is) that software is very large and very complex. He thought that we could create software like a biological system -- systems that have many different parts, but work together. Each part is made up of cells, and there are many kinds of cells. Each kind of cell receives and sends different kinds of messages. Kay thought that if we could create software with different types of cells, each of which knew how to send and receive different kinds of messages, we could concentrate on these types of cells, and software would be easier to write and more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "He invented a programming language that implemented this, call Smalltalk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the beginning of object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of cells, we talk about \"objects\"\n",
    "- Instead of types of cells, we talk about \"classes\"\n",
    "- Instead of talking about sending messages, we talk about \"calling methods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectes have been around for about 50 years now. As we know, software is now easy to write, easy to maintain, very cheap, and... Today, most programming languages have some facility for working with objects, and it's kind of expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, object-oriented programming is a technique for organizing your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you always need to use objects? The answer is \"no.\" Python is agnostic on this -- the underlying language uses objects, but if you want to ignore them, you basically can. Some other languages, like Java, require it of you.\n",

    "- `class` and `type` -- These words are (in Python) pretty much interchangeable. You can't swap them around in your Python program, but when we're talking about objects, you can. A class is a data type, and it's also a factory for objects of that type. If you have a string in Python, then its class is `str`, because `str` created it.\n",

    "    - `str` creates all strings in Python\n",
    "- If we want to create a new value of type `X`, then we invoke `X()`, typically with an argument that will be used as the basis for that value.\n",
    "- `instance` - when I create a new string, we could say that I have created a new *instance* of `str`. A class is a factory for creating objects, or (stated another way) an object is an instance of that factory. Everything is Python is an object, so everything is an instance of something, of some class/type. If you want to know what type of value it is, or what its class is, you can use the `type` function, which returns it.\n",
    "- `object` -- this word is way overused in the object-oriented programming world. It basically means \"a value,\" or \"a noun.\" Sometimes, when we say \"object,\" we mean, \"a value in Python.\" We can say \"that string object\" or \"that dict object.\" We can also say that `str` is a \"class object,\" or sometimes a \"factory object.\" Part of the problem (that we'll talk about tomorrow) is that the word `object` also has a specific meaning in Python -- it's the generic factory that creates all objects."
