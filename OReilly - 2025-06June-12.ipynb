    "In object-oriented programming, we're trying to create custom data structures that are appropriate for solving our custom problems. By defining these custom data structures, we're also able to think at a higher level, talking about the objects we create, rather than the underlying abstract data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By putting these core data structures (e.g., strings, lists, and dicts) inside of a class, we can think and reason about our data at a higher level, and then use our class in other classes.\n",
    "- Methods (verbs) are defined on the class, whihc means that they are tightly bound to a particular data type. Regular functions can be invoked with any type of value, whether it's appropriate or not, whether it'll lead to a crash or not. A method is only available on objects for which it's appropriate. It's easier to get a list of methods on an object, and choose from those, than to look at an (infinitely long) list of functions and figure out what would work with your object.\n",
    "- We define classes (i.e., new data types). A type is a class, and a class is a type. A class is also a factory for creating objects of its type. A `Person` class creates new objects of type `Person` --"
